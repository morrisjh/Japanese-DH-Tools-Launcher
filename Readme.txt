The Japanese DH Tools Launcher is an extension for Google Chrome written in HTML and CSS.

The code is based on Traversy Media's Launcher, which can be found here: https://github.com/bradtraversy/traversy-launcher.
The primary difference between Traversy Media's Launcher and this one are the links included. This laucher seeks to provide quick and easy access to DH tools for those involved in Japan Studies.
Unlike Traversy Media's Launcher, the code here also includes a "flex-wrap" function allowing users to include a greater number of links whilst ensuring that the launcher remains unintrusive in Chrome.
A final difference is the color scheme and fonts used.

Feel free to use the code for your own projects.
